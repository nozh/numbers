153 = 3*3*17

Since {\displaystyle 153=1^{3}+5^{3}+3^{3}}153=1^{3}+5^{3}+3^{3}, it is a 3-narcissistic number, and it is also the smallest three-digit number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits

Another feature of the number 153 is that it is the limit of the following algorithm:[4][5][6]

Take a random positive integer, divisible by three
Split that number into its base 10 digits
Take the sum of their cubes
Go back to the second step
